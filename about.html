      <h1 class="text-center mb-4">About the Air Quality Index (AQI)</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        The AQI is an index for reporting daily air quality. It tells you how
        clean or polluted your air is, and what associated health effects might
        be a concern for you. The AQI focuses on health effects you may
        experience within a few hours or days after breathing polluted air.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-4 text-center">How Does the AQI Work?</h2>
      <p>
        Think of the AQI as a yardstick that runs from 0 to 500. The higher the
        AQI value, the greater the level of air pollution and the greater the
        health concern. For example, an AQI value of 50 represents good air
        quality, while an AQI value over 300 represents hazardous air quality.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-4 text-center">Understanding the AQI</h2>
      <p>
        The AQI is divided into six categories, each corresponding to a
        different level of health concern. Below is a summary of the AQI
        categories as well as health effects of each AQI levels:

              Air quality is acceptable; however, for some pollutants, there may
